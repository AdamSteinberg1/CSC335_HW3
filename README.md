# CSC335 HW3

Programs for homework 3 for CSC 335 Numerical Methods.  
Textbook problems are named after their section and problem number. I.e. `3.1.20.cpp` is the program that solves problem 20 in section 3.1.
Problem 1 from Dr. Pounds is solved by interp_points.cpp.

## Build Instructions
`3.1.20.cpp` and `3.4.9.cpp` are compiled with 
```
c++ program_name.cpp
```  
    
  
All other `.cpp` programs are compiled with
```
c++ program_name.cpp -larmadillo
```  
  
All executables can be ran with 
```
./a.out
```  

## Other Files
`graph.png` is the graph for problem 1 from Dr. Pounds.
